1.) A description of your circuit: what sensor you used, how you are reading the data from the circuit on the Photon. – I have used temperature sensor as input to photon to sense the temperature and send it on cloud. To send the data I have used spark.variable() and to get the data I have used spark.function().

This device uses the following components:
o	Particle Photon
o	One Wire Temperature sensor DS18B20
o	24 LED Neopixel Ring

2.) A description of your visualization: what libraries or techniques you used, and what differences (if any) there are from your code in the first assignment. – 
I have used jQuery Knob library which can be found at http://anthonyterrien.com/knob/ and GitHub repository at https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob this is different from my previous visualization as the previous one had multiple data entries and this is a single data entry. Previously I had used Google charts and Datamaps for visualization previously as location was one of the attributes of the data.

3.) A photograph of your completed circuit, clearly showing all of the elements and their connections. Annotations would be nice but are not required. : Photographs are in images folder.
